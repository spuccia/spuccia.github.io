"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><font color="white" face="Garamond">Speaking from the tongue of an
experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile
camplainee. This note should be pretty easy to understand. All the warnings
from the punk rock 101 courses over the years. Since my first introduction to
the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of
your community has proven to be very true. I haven't felt the exitement of
listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too
many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about these things. For example when
we're backstage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowd begins it
doesn't affect the way in which it did for Freddy Mercury who seemed to love
and relish in the love and adoration from the crowd. Which is something I
totally admire and envy. The fact is I can't fool you. Any one of you. It
simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip
people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100 % fun. Sometimes I
feel as if I should have a punch in time clock before I walk out on stage. I've
tried everything within my power to appreciate it, and I do. God, believe me I
do but it's not enough. <o:p></o:p></font></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><font color="white" face="Garamond">I appreciate the fact that I and we
have affected and entertained a lot of people. I must be one of one of those
narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I
need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasm I once had as a
child. On our last three tours I've had a much better appreciation for all the
people I've known personally and as fans of our music, but I still can't get
over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There's good
in all of us and I think I simply love people too much. So much that it makes
me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, pisces
Jesus man! Why don't you just enjoy it? I don't know. I have a goddess of a
wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of
what I used to be.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p>

"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><font color="white" face="Garamond">Full of love and joy kissing every
person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that
terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can't stand the
thought of Frances becoming the miserable self-destructive, death rocker that
I've become. I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of
seven I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems
so easy for people to get along, and have empathy. Empathy! Only because I love
and feel for people too much I guess. Thank you all from the pit of my burning
nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too
much of an erratic, moody baby! I don't have the passion anymore and so
remember, its better to burn out than to fade away. peace, love, empathy. <o:p></o:p></font></span></p>
